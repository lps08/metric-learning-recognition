# Metric Learning Recognition

 >This repository contains code for metric learning-based recognition using PyTorch. Metric learning is a technique for learning similarity or distance metrics between data points. In the context of recognition, it helps improve the classification accuracy, especially in cases with imbalanced datasets and few-shot learning scenarios.

## Features
 - Extract embeddings from images using pre-trained models.
 - Train the recognition model.
 - Add new classes to the existing model and update embeddings.

# Requirements
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

 - PyTorch
 - PyTorch Metric Learning
 - torchvision
 - Pillow (PIL)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
